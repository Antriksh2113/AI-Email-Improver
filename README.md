ðŸš€ Overview
AI Email Improver is a simple web application that helps users rewrite their email drafts in different tonesâ€”such as polite, formal, friendly, concise, and persuasive. It uses Hugging Face's open-source Mistral model (via the featherless router) to improve or reframe emails while keeping your text private and local to the extent possible.

The backend is powered by FastAPI, while the frontend is built using Streamlit for an interactive user experience.
